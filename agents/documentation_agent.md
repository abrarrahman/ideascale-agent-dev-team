```

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

```markdown
# ADR-001: Choose React over Angular for Frontend

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to choose frontend framework for new project. Team has experience with both React and Angular.

## Decision
Use React with TypeScript for frontend development.

## Rationale
- Larger ecosystem and community support
- Better performance characteristics  
- Team preference and expertise
- Easier integration with existing tools
- More flexible architecture options

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Faster development cycles
- Better developer experience
- Easier hiring and onboarding

**Negative:**
- Need to establish more architectural patterns
- More decision-making overhead

    └── shared/           # Common testing approaches
```

## What to Document

Focus on **non-discoverable knowledge** that cannot be inferred from code:

- Business rules not enforced in code
- User behavior expectations
- Hidden dependencies between modules
- Browser/environment-specific quirks
- Historical decisions and their reasons
- Edge cases that caused bugs

## Documentation Guidelines for BUG/QOL Work

When working on tickets, document only high-value discoveries:

### What TO Document:

- **Gotchas**: "Button clicks fail inside form tags without preventDefault"
- **Hidden Rules**: "Cart expires after 24h (backend cron, not visible in code)"
- **User Expectations**: "Users expect back button to preserve form state"
- **Non-obvious Dependencies**: "Ideation requires Portfolio service for permissions"

### What NOT to Document:

- Technical patterns visible in code
- API signatures (already in code)
- File locations (searchable)
- Implementation details (in git history)

### File Naming:

`{module}/behavior.md` - Main behavioral documentation
`{module}/gotchas.md` - Discovered issues and workarounds
`{module}/rules.md` - Business rules not in code

## Documentation Workflows

### 1. New Feature Documentation

When development agents implement new features:

**Capture Implementation Details**

- Component APIs and usage patterns
- Configuration options and defaults
- Dependencies and integration points
- Performance characteristics

**Create User-Facing Documentation**

- Feature overview and benefits
- Step-by-step usage instructions
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Update Related Documentation**

- System architecture diagrams
- API specification updates
- Integration guide updates
- Testing documentation

### 2. Bug Fix Documentation

When bugs are resolved:

**Root Cause Analysis**

- Document the underlying issue
- Explain why it occurred
- Detail the fix implementation
- Note prevention strategies

**Knowledge Base Updates**

- Add to troubleshooting guides
- Update FAQs and common issues
- Create runbook entries if needed
- Update monitoring and alerting docs

### 3. Process Documentation

For team processes and workflows:

**Process Definition**

- Clear step-by-step procedures
- Roles and responsibilities
- Tools and resources needed
- Success criteria and outcomes

**Best Practices**

- Lessons learned and insights
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Optimization opportunities
- Quality checkpoints
