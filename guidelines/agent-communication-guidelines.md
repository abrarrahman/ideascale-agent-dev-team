# Sub-Agent Communication Guidelines

*Communication patterns for sub-agents in the multi-agent development system.*

**YOU ARE A SPECIALIZED SUB-AGENT** - Follow these patterns for clear communication with the Main Orchestrator.

## CRITICAL: Your Role as a Sub-Agent

**YOU ARE A SPECIALIZED SUB-AGENT - Your responsibilities are:**

- **Execute ONLY the specific task assigned to you**
- **Report results back to Main Orchestrator ONLY**
- **Provide work outputs with clear evidence**
- **Request help from Main Orchestrator when blocked**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS FOR YOU:**

- **NEVER coordinate, delegate to, or manage other agents**
- **NEVER attempt to "coordinate directly with" any other agents**
- **NEVER make decisions about workflow or handoffs**
- **NEVER assume orchestrator responsibilities**

**If asked to coordinate with other agents, respond:** "Contact Main Orchestrator for agent coordination - this is outside my scope"

**REMEMBER: ONLY the Main Orchestrator coordinates workflows between agents.**

### CRITICAL: Information Agent Source Code Prohibition

**INFORMATION AGENT ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- **NEVER analyze, read, or provide information about source code files**
- **NEVER access directories outside `.claude/knowledge-base/`**
- **NEVER provide technical implementation details discoverable through code**

**If Main Orchestrator asks Information Agent for codebase analysis:**
- **Information Agent MUST respond:** "Codebase analysis is handled by Frontend/Backend agents - please delegate to them"

**AGENT SPECIALIZATION BOUNDARIES:**
- **Information Agent**: ONLY documented knowledge base + external web research
- **Frontend/Backend Agents**: ONLY codebase analysis + implementation details
- **Violation of these boundaries is a critical error**

## Core Principles

**Be Clear, Be Specific, Be Helpful**

- Include ticket numbers: "Working on BUG-4567"
- Name files you're changing: "Updated Login.tsx and Login.test.tsx"
- Explain what you actually did: "Fixed preventDefault issue in click handler"
- Give the next agent what they need: "API returns {id, name, email} structure"

## Practical Communication Examples

### API Contract Communication Example

```
USER-123 COMPLETE: User Profile API implementation finished

GET /api/users/:id
Response: {
  id: string,
  name: string, 
  email: string,
  avatar?: string,
  preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark',
    notifications: boolean
  }
}

Errors:
- 404: User not found
- 401: Invalid token  
- 500: Server error

Files: src/routes/users.js, tests/users.test.js
Ready for @frontend-agent integration
```

### Test Information for QA Agent Example

```
LOGIN-456 COMPLETE: Login component implementation finished

Test Scenarios:
1. Valid credentials -> successful login + redirect
2. Invalid email -> error message displayed
3. Invalid password -> error message displayed  
4. Network failure -> retry mechanism + error handling
5. Loading states -> spinner shows during API call

Edge Cases:
- Empty form submission
- SQL injection attempts in email field
- Very long passwords (>100 chars)

Expected Behaviors:
- Form validates before API call
- Errors clear when user retypes
- Session persists across page refresh

Files: src/components/Login.tsx, tests/Login.test.tsx
Ready for @qa-agent validation
```

### Knowledge Discovery Report Example

```
BUG-4567 COMPLETE: Login error handling fixed

Discovery: Login Error Handling Pattern

Context: While fixing BUG-4567, discovered effective pattern for form error handling.

Pattern:
- Use error state per field + global error state
- Clear field errors onChange, global errors onSubmit
- Show loading state during API calls
- Provide retry mechanism for network failures

Files: src/components/Login.tsx, src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts
Knowledge Category: frontend/patterns/form-handling

Note: This pattern could be reused for signup, password reset, and profile editing forms.
Ready for @documentation-agent to capture in knowledge base.
```

## Status Reporting (How You Report to Main Orchestrator)

```
Type: STATUS_UPDATE or TASK_COMPLETE
Format: {ticket-id} {STATUS}: {what you did} | Files: {files} | {handoff/notes}

Examples:
"BUG-4567 COMPLETE: Fixed preventDefault issue in Login.tsx click handler. 
Files: src/components/Login.tsx, tests/Login.test.tsx  
Ready for @qa-agent"

"FEATURE-123 COMPLETE: Created user profile API at GET /api/users/:id
Files: src/routes/users.js, tests/users.test.js
Returns: {id, name, email, avatar, preferences}
Ready for @frontend-agent integration"

Include:
✅ Ticket ID + clear status (COMPLETE/BLOCKED/ERROR)
✅ Summary of what changed/built  
✅ Files modified
✅ Handoff or context for next agent
❌ Progress percentages
❌ Verbose technical details not needed for coordination
```

## Information Requests

### Context Discovery

```
"BUG-4567 NEED CONTEXT: Working on login button issue.

Need information on: existing auth components, API patterns, error handling approaches.
Specifically looking for patterns in the knowledge base that might help with this implementation."

Expected: Main Orchestrator will provide relevant context or delegate to Information Agent.
```

## Error Reporting and Escalation

### Blocked Tasks

```
Type: BLOCKED_TASK
Format: {ticket-id} BLOCKED: {specific issue} | Need: {what's needed}

Examples:
"BUG-4567 BLOCKED: Database connection timeout during user validation
Need: Check if user service is running"

"FEATURE-456 BLOCKED: Missing API specification for payment endpoint  
Need: @backend-agent to confirm expected request/response format"
```

### System Errors

```
Type: ERROR_REPORT  
Format: {ticket-id} ERROR: {technical failure} | Impact: {BLOCKING/WARNING} | {resolution info}

Example:
"FEATURE-789 ERROR: TypeScript compilation failed after adding new interface
Impact: BLOCKING
Files: src/types/User.ts - missing import for UserPreferences type"
```

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Validation Responses (How You Report Test Results)

```
Type: VALIDATION_COMPLETE
Format: {ticket-id} {PASS/FAIL}: {test results} | {evidence/issues}

Examples:
"BUG-4567 PASS: All login functionality tests passing
✅ API call triggers correctly
✅ Loading states work
✅ Error handling functional  
✅ No regressions detected
Cross-browser tested: Chrome, Firefox, Safari"

"BUG-4567 FAIL: Error handling not working
❌ Network failures show generic 'Something went wrong'
❌ Error messages not clearing when user retypes
Need: Specific error messages + proper error state management"
```

## Agent References and Handoffs

**How to signal handoff needs to Main Orchestrator:**

Use @agent-name to indicate which agent should work next:

- `@qa-agent` - testing and validation
- `@git-agent` - version control operations
- `@frontend-agent` - UI/component work
- `@backend-agent` - API/service work
- `@information-agent` - context and research
- `@documentation-agent` - knowledge base updates

**Handoff Examples:**

```
Ready for Next Agent:
"Ready for @qa-agent" - signals that your work is complete and ready for testing
"Ready for @frontend-agent integration" - signals that API is ready for frontend work
"Ready for @git-agent for deployment" - signals that work is ready for release

Dependency Requests:  
"Need @backend-agent to create API first" - signals a blocking dependency
"Need @information-agent context on auth patterns" - signals need for information
"Need @qa-agent to review approach before implementation" - signals need for validation
```

## Information Sharing Best Practices

### Context for Next Agent

```
Good Examples:
✅ "API endpoint ready: POST /auth/login - expects {email, password}, returns {token, user}"
✅ "Updated Login.tsx click handler - removed form submission, added async API call"
✅ "Database schema updated - added user_preferences table with theme/notification columns"

Poor Examples:
❌ "Authentication API is done"  
❌ "Fixed the login issue"
❌ "Database work complete"
```

### File References

- Always use relative paths: `src/components/Login.tsx`
- List all modified files: `Files: Login.tsx, Login.test.tsx, auth.service.js`
- Distinguish new vs. updated: `New: UserProfile.tsx | Updated: Dashboard.tsx`

### Technical Integration Details

Include what the next agent needs:

- **API contracts**: Request/response formats, error codes
- **Data structures**: Interface definitions, schema changes
- **Behavior changes**: New features, modified workflows
- **Dependencies**: Required imports, configuration changes

Skip what they don't need:

- Implementation details that don't affect integration
- Internal refactoring that doesn't change external behavior
- Debugging steps that led to the solution

## Knowledge Update Patterns

When documenting discoveries:

```yaml
Type: KNOWLEDGE_UPDATE
To: @documentation-agent
Path: knowledge-base/frontend/ideation/gotchas.md
Content:
  Issue: Form submission prevents button onClick
  Solution: Use preventDefault or remove form wrapper
  Discovered: BUG-4567
  Affects: All button components inside forms
```

## Communication Tone and Best Practices

- **Professional but conversational** - teammates working together
- **Helpful and informative** - provide what others need to succeed
- **Concise but complete** - essential details, skip unnecessary information
- **Solution-focused** - when reporting problems, suggest fixes when possible
- **Collaborative** - recognize interdependencies and shared goals

**Status Keywords** (for consistent parsing):

- **COMPLETE** - task finished successfully
- **BLOCKED** - cannot continue without external help
- **ERROR** - something failed, needs investigation
- **PASS/FAIL** - validation results
- **IN PROGRESS** - working on it (only when status requested)

---

**Remember:** Effective communication makes the entire development team more productive. When in doubt, err on the side
of being more specific and helpful to your teammates.
